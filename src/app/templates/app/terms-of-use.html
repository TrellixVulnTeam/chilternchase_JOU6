                  <ol>
                    <li>Our store collects data to operate effectively and provide you the best experiences with our
                  services. You provide some of this data directly, such as when you create a personal account.
                  We get some of it by recording how you interact with our services by, for example, using
                  technologies like cookies, and receiving error reports or usage data from software running on
                  your device. We also obtain data from third parties (including other companies). For example, we
                  supplement the data we collect by purchasing demographic data from other companies. We also use
                  services from other companies to help us determine a location based on your IP address in order
                  to customize certain services to your location. The data we collect depends on the services
                  and features you use.</li>

                <li class="heading">How We Use Your Information
                  <ol>
                    <li>Our web site uses the data we collect for three basic purposes: to operate our business and
                  provide (including improving and personalizing) the services we offer, to send communications,
                  including promotional communications, and to display advertising. In carrying out these
                  purposes, we combine data we collect through the various web site services you use to give you a
                  more seamless, consistent and personalized experience. However, to enhance privacy, we have
                  built in technological and procedural safeguards designed to prevent certain data combinations.
                  For example, we store data we collect from you when you are unauthenticated (not signed in)
                  separately from any account information that directly identifies you, such as your name, email
                  address or phone number.</li>
                  </ol>
                </li>
                <li class="heading">Sharing Your Information
                  <ol>
                    <li>We share your personal data with your consent or as necessary to complete any transaction or
                  provide any service you have requested or authorized. For example, we share your content with
                  third parties when you tell us to do so. When you provide payment data to make a purchase, we
                  will share payment data with banks and other entities that process payment transactions or
                  provide other financial services, and for fraud prevention and credit risk reduction. In
                  addition, we share personal data among our controlled affiliates and subsidiaries. We also share
                  personal data with vendors or agents working on our behalf for the purposes described in this
                  statement. For example, companies we've hired to provide customer service support or assist in
                  protecting and securing our systems and services may need access to personal data in order to
                  provide those functions. In such cases, these companies must abide by our data privacy and
                  security requirements and are not allowed to use personal data they receive from us for any
                  other purpose. We may also disclose personal data as part of a corporate transaction such as a
                  merger or sale of assets.</li>
